Comments
 I know that a lot of people have been complaining about the incarnate nerf and because of it there's no point playing Summoning. This is wrong, and I'll explain why :
	- The incarnate is surely much more fragile than before. However, its AP cost efficiency is still very high - meaning that with 2 AP you deal more damage than an average hit (since the summon has 4 AP during its turn). Yes, it's probably too fragile right now so I adjusted the HP scaling to be a slightly higher at low levels, so it can actually take 2 full normal hits before dying and without any strong Summoning investment.
	- For people who says that vanilla summoner was trash, they definitely played it wrong. Vanilla champion incarnate is insanely strong, it has a hidden +50% damage bonus and is extremely bulky. Summoning is actually one of the most OP things in the original game.
	- "If the incarnate is nerfed then summoning bad" : no. Summoning is also all the supporting skills around it - and no, the incarnate isn't the only summon out there. The Bone Widow is terrifying even in vanilla, the Fire slug and Artillery plant both deals insane amounts of damage, ... You can play summoning without the Incarnate as your main summon. And that's what Vanilla+ try to encourage. The incarnate is nerfed because way too versatile for the effort it requires to make it work in vanilla, so each summon shall now be plainly considered instead of mindlessly throwing the same incarnate in every single battle of the game.
	- I can foresee people complaining about a lot of nerfs that happened in this update. Before you yell at me, please read what's following : in this update, all summons (except totems and bomber) deal a more than decent amount of damage with proper investment in Summoning. How could I say that ? There is a damage scaling called AverageLevelDamage which basically takes the level scaled damage and apply the expected average growth from Attributes and Abilities bonuses. It corresponds to a 2AP 100% damage hit - what we can call a "normal" hit. If the damage of a 2 AP hit is under this value, that mean the origin is most likely not optimised enough. If the damage is equal or above, that mean the origin is decently optimised and in the extreme cases min/maxed. I compared the damage of each summon to this value at low, mid and high level. With proper investment in Summoning, they ALL do the at least AverageLevelDamage, and with full investment in Summoning it goes even beyond. So I do not make changes on something because "I don't like this or that". I make changes by considering real values.
	- Don't mistake Summoning for what it's not. Yes, the summons might not make as much damage as that rogue or that mage, etc... So what ? All classes shall be able to do the same amount of damage ? Summoning is probably one of the worst ability possible to make burst damage. It is however extremely good at sustaining constant damage all the time while the caster can soak a lot of hits and provide its summons and teammates a lot of support. Summoning is also very good combined with another abilities and fit very well for a Ranger. Keep in mind that your summons are not just damage makers, but they also occupy space on the battlefield and can be a real annoyance for the enemies. A summoner is not, however, a main damage dealer. If it's what vanilla made you believe because of broken scalings and questionable balancing, then you might be deceived by Summoning in this mod. There are many other mods out there that makes Summoning very powerful - you might consider use one of them with Vanilla+ if Summoning sounds underwhelming for you.
	- The philosophy of the mod is to stay true to vanilla. The issue is - Summoning is the ability that have the most flaws in the original game, so there's no obvious anchor on what direction I shall go. I decided to make Summoning a versatile ability since there are already a lot of ways to do burst damage and do some Michael Bay-grade styled builds.

In summary, I decided to revise all summons for this update since I probably neglected them too much before. I'm open for suggestions but please provide tangible explanation for me to work with.

* Elemental Ranger now provide 1 turn of Elemental Weapon of the same damage type of the special arrow or grenade you used.
* Morning Person do not make you start combat with full AP anymore but instead you get a +2 AP Recovery if your turn have been skipped incapacitating effect(s) (cumulating effects that reduce your AP recovery to 0 also count as incapacitating).

	* Haymaker now convert Critical Chance bonus from Wits to Resistance bypass, and is now incompatible with Savage Sortilege

The resistance debuff is proportional to the Corrosive/Magic damage dealt and the Max Vitality of the victim.
* Acid grenade : inflict 80% Corrosive damage and set Acid for 2 turns. Can be crafted by combining a flask with a source of poison and shadow essence. They should appear as starter grenades.

* Fixed the tooltip of some talents not being up to date with the changes
* Removed Master Thief until it is reworked and functional

# 1.2.13.63 (Gwydian)
Fixes
* Restored Divine Talents visibility since LeaderLib pruned UI support from its last updates (original code from LaughingLeader)

* Using a non-projectile jump while having the Real Jump module shall now properly refund the AP
* Torturer should not make weapon chances to set status to 100% anymore

New
* Linear Vitality Scaling toggle: you can now change the vitality scaling of the game. The linear scaling, as its name implies, make the vitality grow linearly when leveling up instead of exponentially. This results in a greatly reduced equipment obsolescence and more fair inter-level battles (fighting a lower level is harder but fighting a higher level is easier). This opens up exploration paths you couldn't do before because of the level scaling, so it might be a new way to play the game (and possibly break it!)
* You can now customize the Potion dizziness in the options
* You can now craft poutine by combining Rivellon fries with Cheese in an Oven. Thank me later.
* Undead can now benefit of food buffs (credits to LaughingLeader for the fix)

Balance
* Haymaker doesn't ignore the accuracy penalty from higher leveled weapons anymore
* Soft attributes cap is now 30 instead of 40. This can be changed in the options.
* Teleport and Nether Swap now require any enemy to have at least one of its armours depleted to be used. It can still be used on armoured allies and neutrals. This change can be reversed in the modules, since it can potentially break existing combat designs in custom campaigns
* Reduced Critical Multiplier of Spears, Axes, Hammers, Sword, Wands and Staves from 150 to 130, Bows and XBows from 130 to 125 and Daggers from 160 to 150 (unarmed is still 150%). Since critical chance can be obtained much more easily than in vanilla, it has to be counter-balanced by a decrease of their damage (something that was never done since the release, severely impacting combat from middle to end-game)
* Two Handed critical multiplier bonus per point increased from 3% to 4%
* Scoundrel critical multiplier bonus per point increased from 3% to 4%
* Savage Sortilege now gives a flat 10% critical chance instead of multiplying the current critical chance by 1.1	
* Executioner movement boost converted from 50% increase to a flat 2m (similar to Haste)
* Knocked down now nullify dodge of the victim
* Breathing Bubble accuracy increased from 10 to 15
* Breathing Bubble duration reduced from 5 turns to 4
* Alcoholic drinks now set Drunk for 300 turns instead of 150
* Some food items now have different, more interesting effects
* Glass Cannon now nullify base armour

Miscellaneous
* Refactored damage code for more clarity
* Performance should be improved in situations where there are a lot of hits done consecutively

# TODO
* Resistance caps rework : resistance has always been controversial since it's known to bloat at higher levels. The resistance bypass feature by itself is quite limited since you have to build your character around it to be effective and the corrogic module also require specific preparation. As a result, a mage at higher level can get stuck for a couple of turns before being effective whereas physical damage dealers can counter dodge in a single turn. V+ now propose by default to reduce the base cap of resistances to 50%, except if the base resistance is already higher (e.g. a fire slug will still be able to absorb fire attacks).
* Wits increase healings+
* Polish Perseverance effect
* Dodge fatigue rework
* Grenadier talent % chance to give back base ingredients when crafting and % to give back a grenade after use (chance reverse proportional to the price of the grenade)
